    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>
      Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties,
      composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that
      explores the building blocks of the universe.
    </p>
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>
      The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each
      element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for
      hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and
      periods based on their properties.
    </p>
    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>
      Chemical reactions are represented using chemical equations. Here's an
      example of a chemical reaction:
    </p>
    <p><code>2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O</code></p>
    <p>
      This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (H2) and oxygen
      gas (O2) to form water (H2O).
    </p>
    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    Stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical
    reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and
    charge are conserved.
    <p>
      Subscripts indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule,
      while superseripts represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.
    </p>
    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>
      Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From
      the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our
      bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives
